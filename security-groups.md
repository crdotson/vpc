# Using Security Groups in IBM Cloud VPC Beta

Security groups give you a convenient way to apply rules that establish filtering to each network interface of a virtual server instance (VSI), based on IP address.

By default, a security group denies all traffic. As rules are added to a security group, it defines the traffic that the security group permits.

Rules are _stateful_, which means that reverse traffic in response to allowed traffic is automatically permitted. So for example, a rule allowing inbound TCP traffic on port 80 also allows replying outbound TCP traffic on port 80 back to the originating host, without the need for an additional rule.

Security groups are scoped to a single VPC. This scoping implies that security group can be attached _only_ to network interfaces of VSIs within the same VPC.

When a VSI is created without any security groups specified, the VSI's primary network interface is put into the _default_ security group of that VSI's VPC. {{site.data.keyword.cloud}} VPC Beta release has a defined default security group that does allow certain traffic.

For more information, including examples of how to provision a VSI with security groups, please see our [Security Groups Usage Examples document](security-group-usage-examples.html)

### Default Security Groups

Each VPC has a default group, with rules to allow:

* Inbound traffic from all other members of the group.
* Outbound traffic to all other members of the group.
* Inbound SSH traffic from everywhere.
* Inbound ping traffic from everywhere.

If you edit the rules of the default security group, those edited rules will then apply to all current and future servers in the group.

**Notes:** Because Security Groups are not currently editable in the IBM Console UI, inbound rules to allow ping and SSH have been added to the default security group as a convenience. These 2 rules will no longer be added to the default security group for new VPCs later in the Beta release timeframe, once the Security Group UI has been released. However, they will remain on any default security groups created before this change. Rule modifications to the default security group must be made using the REST API, or the experimental `ibmcloud cli`, for example:

```
# Add rules allowing SSH and PING
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction ingress --protocol tcp --ipv 4 --min-port 22 --max-port 22 634533
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction ingress --protocol icmp --icmp-type 8 --icmp-code 0 634533
```

## APIs and CLIs currently available

These endpoints can be used to manage a VPC's default security group.

In order to use the API calls you will need to use some form of REST client.
For example, using curl to retrieve all current security groups:
```bash
curl -X GET $rias_endpoint/v1/security_groups -H "X-Auth-Token: $iam_token"
```

| Description | API | CLI |
|-------------|-----|-----|

### Limitation of the current Beta release:

 * The PATCH operation on a security group rule cannot modify the rule's protocol.

 * Default security groups are available for VPCs created after May 24 only.

 * Adding or removing network interfaces from a security group works for network interfaces on servers ordered after May 19 only.

 * Network interfaces added to a security group are functional, however they are not viewable through the API for VSIs created before June 22. This is a permanent limitation for VSIs ordered before June 22, 2018.


### Coming soon in IBM Cloud VPC Beta

| Description | API | CLI |
|-------------|-----|-----|
|Retrieve a single network interface specified by the identifier in the URL path. The network interface must be an existing member of the security group. | GET /security_groups/{security_group_id}/network_interfaces/{id}| `ibmcloud is security-group-network-interface`, `sg-nic`|


## Security groups demo example

In the example that follows, you'll create a VSI with a security group enabled, using the command line interface (CLI). Here's what the scenario looks like.

![image3](/images/security-groups-schematic.png)

Notice in the figure that the VSI named **SG4** has a floating IP `169.60.208.144` assigned to it, in addition to its internal VPC address `10.0.0.5`; therefore, it can talk to the public internet. The security group assigned to VSI **SG4** is named "demosg".

The VSI named **SG8** is internal-only to the VPC, with a private IP address. The security group assigned to VSI **SG8** is named "my_vpc_sg". Both of these VSIs exist within the VPC named `sgvpc` and also on the same subnet `10.0.0.0/28` so they can communicate with each other. For the internal Beta release, it is a limitation that the security groups for these VSIs cannot be deleted once the VSI has been created with an attached security group, but the security group rules can be modified at will.

## Example code

The example code that follows shows how to set up the security group rules for "my_vpc_sg" to include basic functions of SSH, PING, and outbound TCP.

Notice that you must create the security group first, with the `ibmcloud is sg-create` command, and then create the VSI that will include this newly-created security group. Essentially, you will just add a parameter at the end of your VSI creation command, which specifies the ID of the security group (that you just created). In the example below, the security group ID is `581969`.

This example code skips a few steps, so here's where you can find more information:

 * Instructions for creating a VPC and a subnet are available in our [example code document](example-code.html#example-code-tutorial).

You can copy and paste commands from this example CLI code to get you started creating a VSI that has a security group attached. System responses are not shown completely in this sample code. You'll need to update your commands with the correct resource IDs for your _VPC_, _subnet_, _image_, and _key_, and the correct _security group ID number_.

**Step 1. Log in**

```
ibmcloud login -sso
ibmcloud sl init
```
{: codeblock}

**Step 2. Choose how to configure IBM Cloud Infrastructure (SoftLayer) authentication:**

1. Login with your SoftLayer user name and password or API key

2. Use Bluemix Single-Sign-On

```
Enter a number> 2                                             # choose option 2
API endpoint URL: [https://api.softlayer.com/mobile/v3.1]>    # make sure this is your API endpoint
```

**Step 3. Create Security Group “my_vpc_sg”**

```
ibmcloud is sg-create --name my_vpc_sg --vpc e636a5de-391d-456d-badb-9a9570259a51
```
{: codeblock}

The response includes your newly created SG ID: **581969** (in this case, yours may differ)

**Step 4. Add rules allowing SSH, PING, and outbound TCP**

```
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction ingress --protocol tcp --ipv 4 --min-port 22 --max-port 22 581969
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction ingress --protocol icmp --icmp-type 8 --icmp-code 0 581969
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction egress --protocol tcp
```
{: codeblock}

**Step 5. Create VSI with newly created SG**

```
ibmcloud is instance-create --name sg8 --gen gc --type virtual --subnet 42e0789f-ee21-42b5-a448-37e4f6302ef6 --zone us-south-1 --vpc e636a5de-391d-456d-badb-9a9570259a51 --flavor B1_1X2X25 --image cc8debe0-1b30-6e37-2e13-744bfb2a0c11 --key 51ddf6e5-d717-4202-a242-82612b2864fd --port 100 --sec-group 581969
```
{: codeblock}

## Command list cheat sheet

For a complete list of the available VPC CLI commands for security groups, type:

```
ibmcloud is help | grep sg
```

To see your security group and its metadata including rules, you'd type (for the previous example):

```
ibmcloud is sg-get 581969
```

**Note:** For the general case, substitute the correct security group ID for your own VSI's security group.

To add a security group rule, here's an example command for adding a PING ingress rule to a security group with ID 569403:

```
ibmcloud is sg-rule-add --direction ingress --protocol icmp --icmp-type 8 --icmp-code 0 569403
```
{: codeblock}
